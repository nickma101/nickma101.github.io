I am a (computational) social scientific researcher with a particular interest in the interplay of new technologies, the (news) media, and democratic society. The majority of my research engages with responsible design practices for digital platforms. During my PhD, I researched avenues towards and consequences of nudging news engagement (e.g. "Can we nudge people towards reading political news?", "Does such nudging translate into democratically relevant media effects (e.g. learning)?" and "How to facilitate diverse information diets in algorithmically curated environments?").
In my current postdoc, I am broadening this scope by working on challenges around misinformation, with a particular focus on responsible labeling practices of artificially created content. Currently, I am working on a set of experiments to probe the effects of AI disclosures on how readers perceive information and to what extend they trust it.

I am strong proponent of open science and strive to bring together insights from different academic disciplines. Methodologically, I predominantly use digital (field) experiments, at times enriched through qualitative and computational research methods.

For my experiments, I have developed several open source tools that are available on my GitHub. Those include an experimental news website (Python backend, react frontend) that can be altered and extended for online experiments with news content as well as several web scrapers for a list of UK news outlets.
